“AMES: Automated Machine Learning Expert System” is a system which automates the task of building a Machine Learning model for a given dataset using the most accurate algorithm for Classification and Regression tasks. Such a system will increase productivity by automating repetitive tasks, helping to avoid errors that might creep in due to manual processes and democratizing Machine Learning by making the power of ML accessible to everybody. Tasks such as hyperparameter optimisation, feature engineering, data pre-processing, visualisation and even model selection, if automated, will prove to be of great benefit to ML Engineers and novice users alike. This project aims to automate all these tasks and make the process of building a model simple, quick and efficient.
